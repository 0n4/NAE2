## About

Neeve's AE2: Extended Life Additions (NAE2) is a utility mod aimed to streamline some of the [Applied Energistics 2: Extended Life interactions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ae2-extended-life). This mod doesn't offer a wide array of features right now, more planned later.

# Features

NAE2 introduces an item named "Pattern Multi-Tool", a device crafted to streamline your interactions with patterns, allowing you to multiply, divide, add, subtract and unencode patterns in bulk, dramatically reducing the time you'd typically spend performing these actions individually. Especially when upgrading [GregTech CE: Unofficial](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gregtech-ce-unofficial) machines with high tiers of Parallel Control Hatches. Yeah, that's mainly why I made it.

----

Created primarily for use in [Nomifactory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomifactory), a GregTech CE based modpack.
